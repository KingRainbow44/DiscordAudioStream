# Capture presets

You may need to switch between different configurations without stopping your stream.  
For example, you may want to stream your entire desktop sometimes, but only a specific window other times, or switch between different audio devices.

To make this easier, you can create capture presets. There are 5 slots available, which you can use to save and load different configurations. A preset contains the following information:

- Video capture area (the shown window, screen or custom area).
- Captured audio device.
- Whether to capture the cursor.
- Whether to hide the taskbar.
- Stream title (text shown in the DiscordAudioStream window title bar for easier identification).
- Video output scale.

To save/load the current configuration to/from a preset, click the *Save* button and select a slot. You can also right-click the DiscordAudioStream window while streaming to open the context menu.  
The fastest way to control presets is to use the keyboard shortcuts. Store the current configuration in a preset with `Ctrl+Shift+1` to `Ctrl+Shift+5`, and restore it later with `Ctrl+1` to `Ctrl+5`.
